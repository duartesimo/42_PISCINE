# 42_PISCINE
The 42 Porto Piscine is an intensive 26-days programming program designed to teach participants Shell Script and C languages. The goal is to prepare students for the selection process at the 42 programming school, where an innovative peer-to-peer learning method is adopted.

# Peer-to-peer Learning
A unique aspect of the 42 Porto Piscine is the utilization of peer-to-peer learning. Participants engage in collaborative learning, sharing knowledge, and helping each other grow throughout the program. This collaborative environment fosters a dynamic and interactive learning experience.

# My Journey
I started with no C language knowledge and not that many programming skills, just the very basic in Python. The Piscine allowed me to learn alongside my peers. The peer-to-peer learning approach helped a lot in my journey from knowing 0 about the C language to developing projects. Successfully completing this Piscine was really rewarding, since it is one of the world's premier programming schools. The skills and experiences gained during the Piscine solidified my passion for coding.
